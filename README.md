## Usage
- Run `go run main.go login` to set the auth cookie
- Run `go run main.go continue` to setup the next problem, including the code file and the input 
- Run `go run main.go run` to run the next problem's code
    - Add the `--submit/-s` flag to submit your response
    - You can specify which problem you want to run at the end: e.g. the `go run main.go run 2024_01_2` (you can ommit the file extension). Use `go run main.go run 2024_01_2_alt_a` to run alternative solutions.
